# VeriSnake – Snake Game on FPGA  
A hardware-level implementation of the classic Snake game using Verilog HDL, designed for the Basys3 FPGA board with real-time VGA output.

## 🎮 Overview  
The goal is to simulate the retro Snake game using Finite State Machines and display it via VGA on an external monitor. The game will include movement control, food collection, and collision logic.

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- Verilog HDL  
- Xilinx Vivado  
- VGA Protocol (640x480)  
- Basys3 FPGA Board

## 🚧 Project Status  
**Currently in development.** VGA display and basic pixel rendering verified. FSM logic for snake control and collision detection in progress.

## 📌 Project Timeline  
**June 2025 – July 2025**
